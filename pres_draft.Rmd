# Background

Our interest is in persistent asthma in minority children. 

* Comprehensive school-based interventions in collaboration with communities to reduce asthma morbidity and promote physical activity in urban areas.

* A pilot cluster RCT was conducted exploring this intervention in Bronx elementary schools
  - **Goal:** whether Children in schools receiving Asthma-PASS intervention may experience a greater improvement in the number of SFD at 6 **or** 12 months follow up than the children in the comparison group. 
  - 4 Bronx elementary schools were recruited into the pilot study. 
  - A total of 108 children recruited including ages 4-11 years with physician-diagnosed persistent or uncontrolled asthma attending kindergarten to 5th grades

  facet_grid(.~school)
```




# Data Exploration 

**Current outcome:** SFD (Count data)

- Due to the skewed distribution towards higher values a poisson model will not fit our data well
- Outcome does not seem linear over the time observations. 

*Interested in the change from baseline to observation times.* 

**New outcome:** Change in SFD (Continuous Data)

- Transform the SFD by calculated: 
  * 6 month observation - baseline 
  * 12 month observation - baseline 
- Baseline with become covariate

# Model Specifications

To model change in SFD let $i$ for school, $j$ for subjects, $k$ for measures. 

We will used mixed effect model. 

\begin{align*}
Y_{ijk} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 Baseline_{ij} \\
&+ \beta_2 Group_{ij} + \beta_3 Compare_{ijk} \\
& + \beta_4 Group_{ij}\times Compare_{ijk} \\
&+ \alpha_{0i} + \alpha_{0j} + \epsilon_{ijk} 
\end{align*}

where $\alpha_{0i} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_1)$,  $\alpha_{0j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_2)$,  and $\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. 

We will be assuming data is missing at random (MAR)$^{[1]}$.

# Cluster RCT design

*	The investigators wish to propose a **cluster-randomized clinical trial (RCT)** in 30 Bronx schools to evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention program. 

* Primary hypothesis: compared to the control group, children in schools randomized to intervention group will experience a greater improvement in the number of SFD at **any of the 3, 6, 9, and 12 months** assessment. 

* The investigators would like to have at **80% probability** to declare the trial is successful if the true effect size in **improvement of SFD over time** is **at least 1/3 standard deviation**. 

# Study design proposal:

* The primary interest of the study:  test whether there is difference at any of the 3,6,9,12 months;
* Consider 4 comparisons separately:
  * month3: sfd_chage~group
  * month6: sfd_chage~group
  * month9: sfd_chage~group
  * month12: sfd_chage~group
  
**Two levels of Sampling**

- $N_1$: Number of Individuals in each School *(What we want to estimate)*
- $N_2$: Number of Schools for one treatment arm (15 in our case)


# Study design proposal:

**2 level structure**$^{[2]}$:

$$
y_{ij} = \beta_0+\beta_1X_{ij}+\beta_2y_{0,ij}+u_i+\epsilon_{ij}
$$


* i for school, j for subject, $y_{ij}$ is the sfd_change from tested time point to baseline
* within each comparison, there is only 1 measurement. So no consideration of the intra-subject correlation
* $u_i\sim N(0, \sigma_2^2)$, random intercept between schools
* $\epsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma_e^2)$, random error term 

**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient**


$$
\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_2}{\sigma^2_2 + \sigma^2_e}
$$

# Hypothesis Set Up

**Hypothesis:**$H_0:\beta_1=0, H_1:\beta_1\neq0$

* calculate N based on normal distribution, with multiple adjustment: $\alpha^* = \alpha/4 = 0.025/4$
* $\beta = 0.2$
* $N_1=N_0=15$
* Interested in when standardized effect size $\Delta = 1/3$


# Sample Size Calculation 

**Test statistics**

$$
D_{2}=\frac{\sqrt{N_{2} N_{1}}\left(\bar{Y}_{1}-\bar{Y}_{0}\right)}{\sigma \sqrt{2 (1-\rho)}} \sim N(0,1)
$$

**Sample Size formula**

$$
N_{1}=\frac{2(1-\rho) z_{\alpha^*, \phi}^{2}}{N_{2} \Delta_{(2)}^{2}-2 \rho z_{\alpha^*, \phi}^{2}}
$$
Where $z$ is calculated based on the normal distribution.

$$
z_{\alpha^*, \beta}^2 = (z_{\alpha^*/2}+z_{\beta})^2 = \left[\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha^*/2)+\Phi^{-1}(1-\beta)^{-1}\right]^2
$$
